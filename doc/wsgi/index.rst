.. _WSGI Server:

WSGI Server
===========

Yimmo-WSGI is a PEP3333 compliant WSGI server. It's written in C and built atop
the following libraries:

- `libev`_ for IO readiness notifications
- `libbsat`_ to manage timeouts
- `libyimmo`_ for network IO and HTTP

It `embeds`_ the Python interpretter (...I know, hang in).

The core I/O is handled using a traditional event-driven reactor pattern.
Application concurrency is provided by distributing request workloads across
a configurable number of processes and/or threads (both can also be ``1``).

The basic idea: use python to *handle* requests; use C for *I/O*.

Usage
-----

Configuration is done through env vars.
You run it like this:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/some/path/to/modules yimmo-wsgi MODULE_NAME APP_NAME
```

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following settings control the ``yimmo-wsgi`` runtime:

- ``YIMMO_LOG_LEVEL``: Log level. For more info, see :ref:`Logging <WSGI Logging>`
- ``YIMMO_WSGI_NO_PROC``: Number of ``yimmo-wsgi`` processes to run.
- ``YIMMO_WSGI_NO_THREADS``: Number of ``yimmo-wsgi`` worker thread, **per_process**.
- ``YIMMO_WSGI_USE_KQUEUE``: Set to ``1`` on BSD-like systems to use ``kqueue`` (defaults to ``0``, wich falls back to using ``select()``).

Logging
~~~~~~~


.. warning::
   - At the moment, logging is implemented as line-buffered writes to ``stderr``.
   - ``yimmo-wsgi`` log levels do *not impact the python* ``logging`` *levels.*

Levels
......

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: auto

   * - Level Name
     - Description
   * - ``FATAL``
     - An event has occurred which is considered unrecoverable. The process is
       likely to abort, if it hasn't already.
   * - ``ERROR``
     - An event has occurred which limits or prevents normal operation for at least
       one connection.
   * - ``WARNING``
     - An error may occur if no corrective action is taken.
   * - ``NOTICE``
     - An anomlous or noteworthy event has taken place.
   * - ``INFO``
     - General non-error, no-developer information.
   * - ``DEBUG``
     - General non-error, developer information.
   * - ``TRACE``
     - This is a log level intended library development. It provides fine-grained
       logging on most of the internal functions.

.. note::
   Log levels can be configured at runtime, but *only within* the range built-in
   at compile time â€” see ``YMO_LOG_LEVEL_MIN`` and ``YMO_LOG_LEVEL_MAX`` in the
   `core build parameters documentation <index.html>`_.


Concurrency
-----------

Every *worker process* has *at least two* threads:

 #. One **"server thread"** that does I/O using yimmo, ev, and bsat.
 #. One or more **"worker threads"** that handle requests (providing the PEP3333 interface to the application).

Queues are used to ferry HTTP information between the two.

There are some locks involved. It is tolerable. Don't worry.

Hey, what about gevent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application is I/O bound in the request handlers themselves (e.g. lots
of reading/writing of files, or making additional HTTP requests to upstreams
as part of handling requests), you can happily monkey-patch `gevent`_
into your WSGI application, and it'll all work out just fine.

Summary
~~~~~~~

- **multi-processing**: *increases throughput* by reducing GIL contention.
- **multi-threading**: *reduce latency* (with a *very minor* decrease in throughput)
  incurred by *CPU-bound* request handlers, by allowing long-running and
  short-running requests to be handled concurrently.
- **gevent**: *reduce latency* incurred by *IO-bound* request handlers, by
  auto-patching non-blocking file and network I/O and lightweight cooperative
  multi-threading (`greenlets`_) into your app.
