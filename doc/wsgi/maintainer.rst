Thread Interaction

      :alt: A Request/Response pair gets grouped into a box labeled, "exchange". All the exchanges for a connection are grouped into a box labeled "session."
      :target: _images/Yimmo-HTTP-Entities.png

      A request and it's associated response form an **exchange.**
      A session encapsulates all of the exchanges on a single TCP connection.


Every *worker process* has *at least two* threads:

#. One **"server thread"** that does I/O using yimmo, ev, and bsat.
#. One or more **"worker threads"** that handle requests (providing the PEP3333 interface to the application).

There are some locks and some reference counting involved. It is tolerable.
Don't worry.

Queues (:c:type:`ymo_queue_t`) are used to ferry HTTP information between the
two. Each worker thread has two queues, one for input, one for output. Each
queue has an associated lock (``pthread_mutex_t``).

The WSGI module implements an HTTP request handler callback
(:c:type:`ymo_http_cb_t`) which combines the request (:c:type:`ymo_http_request_t`)
and response (:c:type:`ymo_http_response_t`) into a single unit, the exchange
(:c:type:`ymo_wsgi_exchange_t`).

After creating the exchange, the callback locks the input queue for the worker
associated with the connection, enqueueus the exchange, and signals the worker
thread using a pthread condition variable.

Upon waking (or after completing the task at hand â€” the worker may have been
handling another request in parallel while ``libyimmo_http`` was doing IO) the
worker thread acquires the input queue lock, dequeues the exchange, acquires the
GIL, packages the encapsulated information up as a python ``yimmo.Context``,
and invokes the WSGI application, passing ``environ`` and
:py:meth:`yimmo.Context.start_response`.
